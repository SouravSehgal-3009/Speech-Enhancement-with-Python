# Speech-Enhancement-with-Python
Speech enhancement is the task of taking a noisy speech input and producing an enhanced speech output. With the help of python libraries, Speech Enhancement has been done on a noisy audio file by three different ways: 

**1. Moving Average (Time Domain Filtering):** The moving average filter is a simple Low Pass FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter commonly used for regulating an array of sampled data/signal. It takes M samples of input at a time and takes the average of those to produce a single output point.

**2. Frequency Domain Filtering:*

**3. Spectral Subtraction :*
